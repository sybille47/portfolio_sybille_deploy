                    This project aims to showcase features to enable clients with investment in funds to manage their investments online.
                    Authenticated users can view the value on their funds, place orders and view their order history.
                    Personal details can be managed through the platform.
                    Charts visualise investment allocation and performance.</p>

                  <p class="useCase">
                    <strong>My Role</strong><br>
                    This is a project I realised on my own.
                    Based on my experience in the fund industry, I started with the business analysis
                    to collect the requirements for a basic application, and compiled use cases, user story map and flow charts.
                    Following this, I started the development of the frontend and backend using React with an express.js server and a PostgreSQL database.
                    Coding has been partially supported by AI.

      <p class="aboutMeParagraph">
        I didn’t start my career planning to become a Business Analyst. My early roles were operational,
        deep in the day-to-day processes of the fund administration world.
        Over time, I became fascinated by the systems that supported those processes -
        the tools people relied on, the limitations they worked around, and the potential to make things better.
        That curiosity eventually led me to a software vendor, where I had the opportunity to collaborate closely
        with developers and software architects. Seeing how product decisions were made - and how much impact good analysis and communication could have -
        sparked something in me. I realized I enjoyed understanding how things fit together just as much as I enjoyed improving them.
        </p>

        <p class="aboutMeParagraph">
          That’s how I grew into the Business Analyst role: not by choosing it upfront, but by following the problems I wanted to solve.
          Today, I’m a PMI-PBA certified IT Business Analyst who loves turning complex needs into clear, practical solutions.
          I enjoy bridging business and technical perspectives, working with teams to refine ideas, and helping shape features
          that genuinely improve users’ workflows.
          To strengthen the technical side of my work, I’m currently studying business informatics and web development.
          Understanding how systems behave under the hood helps me design better requirements and collaborate more effectively with technical teams.
          My approach to analysis is rooted in communication, clarity, and collaboration.
          I believe the best results come from well-structured conversations, shared understanding,
          and documentation that makes sense to everyone — not just to the people who wrote it.
        </p>

        <p class="aboutMeParagraph">
        Over the years, I’ve developed expertise in:
        requirements elicitation and analysis
        workshops, training, and product presentations
        creating BRDs, FRDs, flowcharts, user guides, and other documentation

        And I’ve worked across several domains, including:
        fund administration and finance
        HR systems
        user management and profiles

        If there’s a theme in my career, it’s this: I’m driven by improving how people work, one thoughtful solution at a time.

        I love working in a field that continually challenges me and gives me the opportunity to shape solutions that genuinely help people.
